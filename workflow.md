# Ontology workflow

From various resources, the goal is to organize and manage the flow into the ODK pipeline.

Ex.

1) Airtable -> Downloader -> TSV convert -> ODK-DOSDP pattern import using makefile
2) CSV import -> TSV convert -> ODK-DOSDP pattern import using makefile
3) Protege manually edit terms

Each of these paths require releasing the ontology once imports are completed.
